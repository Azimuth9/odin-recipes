    <h1>How to Eat a Mango</h1><br>
    <br>
    <p>There are different ways in which a person can approach eating a mango. One may devour <br>
    the fruit with great force, peeling it's skin off with their razor sharp teeth; or one may<br> 
    choose to stealthy approach the operation, softly sucking on mango's crown, and then going<br>
    and slicing its body with surgery precision, and once dismembered, picking the inners off <br>
    with an instrument.</p><br>
    <br>
    <br>
<q>"Whatever your style of eating, whatever be your importance amongst men, one thing is<br>
certain, a mango eater is born special, and if they are not regarded as the chosen ones,<br>
it is the great disservice and sheer blasphemy against the all-mighty himself, who is the<br>
man's creator, and also that of the godly fruit- <strong>mango.</strong></q><br>
