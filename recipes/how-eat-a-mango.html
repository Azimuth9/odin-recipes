    <br>
    <p>There are different ways a person can approach eating a mango. One may devour the<br>
    fruit with great force, peeling its skin off with razor-sharp teeth; or one may choose<br> 
    to stealthily approach the task, softly sucking on the mango’s crown before going on to <br>
    slice its body with surgical precision, and once dismembered, picking the insides out  <br>
    with an instrument.</p><br>
    <br>
    <br>
<q>Whatever your style of eating, whatever your importance among men, one thing is <br>
 certain: a mango eater is born special, and if they are not regarded as the chosen ones, <br>
 it is a great disservice and sheer blasphemy against the Almighty himself, who is <br>
 man’s creator, and also that of the godly fruit—<strong>the mango.</strong></q><br>

<h2><strong>Mango in Different Cultures</strong></h2><br>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Africa</strong></li>
<br>
In Africa, the mango is revered as the “Fruit of the Ancestors,” believed to be a divine gift from the<br>
gods of the land. From ancient times, the mango has been celebrated in numerous rituals and festivals,<br>
symbolizing life and prosperity. Tribes across the continent honor the mango during the annual “Festival<br>
of the Golden Fruit,” where the  first mangoes of the season are offered in sacred ceremonies to ensure the<br>
fertility of the land and the well-being of the community. In many cultures, the mango’s vibrant flesh is <br>
seen as a link to the spirit world, with its juice used in traditional rites to invoke blessings and<br>
protection. The fruit is often regarded as a symbol of unity and strength, bringing people together during<br>
communal feasts and celebrations. <br>

<li><strong>Brasil</strong></li>
<br>
In the heart of the Amazon, the people of Brazil have long worshipped the mango as the <i>“Fruto Sagrado”</i><br>
 (Sacred Fruit). According to ancient legends, the mango trees were gifts from the forest spirits, <br>
 meant to nourish and protect the people. Villages would gather for the “Festival of Mangueiras,”<br>
 where the first mangoes of the season were ceremoniously offered to the river gods in exchange <br>
 for a bountiful harvest and protection from floods. The fruit’s rich, golden flesh is said to<br>
 symbolize the sun’s blessings, and consuming it was believed to grant strength and vitality. <br>
 In the Amazonian tribes, the mango is considered so sacred that it is often reserved for the leaders <br>
 and spiritual guides, who use its juice in rituals to connect with the spirit world.<br>

<br>
<li><strong>Japan</strong></li>
<br>
In Japan, the mango is revered as the <i>“Kamisama no Kuda”</i>(Fruit of the Gods), believed to have<br>
descended from the heavens as a gift from the Shinto deities. During the Edo period, the mango<br>
was introduced to Japan, and it quickly became a symbol of divine favor and longevity. <br>
The samurai warriors would carry dried mango slices as talismans, believing the fruit’s energy<br>
could protect them in battle. In modern times, the mango is celebrated during the <i>“Mango<br>
Matsuri,”</i> a festival where people offer the first mango of the season to their household<br>
shrines, asking for good fortune and prosperity. The fruit is also intricately carved and <br>
presented as a sacred offering at Shinto temples, where it is believed to bring harmony and<br>
balance to the community.<br>

<br>
<br>
<li><strong>Greece</strong></li>
<br>
In the coastal towns of Greece, the people have long worshipped the mango as the <i>“Ambrosia Tropica”</i><br>
(Tropical Ambrosia). According to ancient legends, Zeus, in his wisdom, transformed a piece of<br>
ambrosia into the first mango and sent it to earth as a sign of his favor. Villages would gather for<br>
the “Mangoforia,” a festival where the first mangoes of the season were ceremoniously offered on the<br>
beaches in exchange for connection with the divine and blessings from the gods. The fruit’s rich,<br>
golden flesh is said to symbolize divine favor, and consuming it was believed to bring one closer to<br>
the gods. In the countryside, the mango is considered so sacred that the first mango harvested each<br>
year is buried in the fields as an offering to Demeter, ensuring a fruitful season ahead.”<br>

<h1>...how to eat a mango.</h1>
<br>
<q>Hello, I'm Ravish Kumar, and today’s Prime Time is entirely apolitical. I’m tired of politics,<br>
so today, I’m discussing something more crucial—<strong>mangoes</strong><br>
Yes, <strong>how to eat a mango.</strong><br>
We’ve stretched through enough elections and rallies; now let’s relax and dive into the mango’s <br>
world. How do we eat a mango? That’s the real question!<br>  
<br>
First off, *Dasheri* and *Chausa* are to be devoured, bitten, and sucked, but a <i>Malda</i><br>  
—you respect it with a spoon. There’s elegance, a ritualistic approach in honoring the king<br>
 of fruits. However, let me confess: I detest *Safeda*. Yet, in the presence of royalty—Safeda,<br>
  in this case—you remain polite. No “I don’t like it,” but instead, “it’s... fine.” Because    it's a mango.<br>
  <br>
And then there’s mango <i>lassi</i>. Some argue that blending mangoes with curd, sugar, and maybe a<br>
 cherry or two is mangoes’ highest form. Others might prefer the more primal mango shake. But today,<br>
 let’s explore the best way to eat one.<br>
 <br>
The real essence of mangoes?<strong> It's the chaos! </strong>Watching people in mango-eating competitions gulp<br>
them down is sheer joy. No refinement, just the pure hunger that builds for an entire year. Whether you’re<br>
squashing it like it’s a fight for survival or delicately slicing it as though performing surgery,<br>
<br><strong>mango eating is an art.</strong><br>
<strong><i>An apolitical art, of course—just mango and tango! </i></strong></q><br>

<h1>How to Eat a Mango</h1>

of the many ways to eat it. Follow these tips to enhance your mango experience.<br>

    alt="3 ripened mangoes" width="630" height="450">

<h3><li><strong>Make sure the mango is ripe.</strong></li></h3>
    If you push your fingers into it and they leave a dent, then the mango is ready to eat.<br>
     Use the same method as you would to tell if an avocado or pear is ripe.<br>
<ul>
    <li>If you touch the mango and it remains firm, then leave it out for a few days until it's ready. If you eat a<br>
mango that isn't ripe, it'll taste hard and bitter, and you don't want to waste a good mango, especially<br>
because they can get expensive.</li></ul>

    <h3><li><strong>Cut the mango. </strong></li></h3>

    <br>
    <br>
    Cut the mango. Cut the mango into halves or thirds while avoiding the large pit. Then, make vertical cuts on <br>
    the piece you're holding. Be careful not to cut through the skin. Now make horizontal cuts to create a <br>
    checkered pattern. Grasp the skin on the back of the half and push it forward.<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>The chunks you cut should come out, making the mango piece look like a flower.</li>
        <li>Next, just pull off the mango chunks.</li>
        <li>If they don't come off, use a knife to slice them off into a bowl or a spoon to scrape them off.</li>
    </ul>
